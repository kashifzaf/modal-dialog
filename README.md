## Create a WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant Modal

Put any content you want in the modal, ensure it is dismissable or closable,
include comments to help us understand your choices, the modal must prevent 
interaction with the underlying page until dismissed or actioned.

Write some tests to confirm that the modal works and is compliant.

Create some styles, remember any styles should also be WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant

NB: Getting the task done is more important than it being complete, don't worry about implementing 
the solution in a single file

Use comments to explain missing parts of the implementation or to explain where you stopped
and why - the more comments you leave us the easier it will be for use to understand how you
write code
